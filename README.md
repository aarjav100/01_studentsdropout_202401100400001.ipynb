The prediction of student dropout is a critical task for educational institutions aiming to reduce dropout rates and improve student retention. Dropout prediction is essential for identifying at-risk students early, allowing institutions to intervene with appropriate measures such as academic support, counseling, or financial assistance. Factors such as attendance rate, average grades, and class participation have been shown to correlate with student performance and retention. This report aims to predict student dropout using these features, employing machine learning techniques such as Random Forest Classifier to build a model for classification.
